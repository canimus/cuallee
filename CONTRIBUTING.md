# Contributing to [cuallee](https://github.com/canimus/cuallee)

`cuallee` is open source software. We value feedback and we want to make contributing to this project as
easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Submitting code changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. Unit tests are split by library `test/unit/pandas...`, `test/unit/pyspark...`, add your own
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Issue that pull request and wait for it to be reviewed by a maintainer or contributor! `black` and `flake8` will lint your code automatically via Github Actions

## Report bugs using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/canimus/cuallee/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.
Be aware that regardless of the missleading word `issue`, we use Github issues to track new `features`, `enhancements`, etc.
So please review the existing list of issues, to make sure your request is not duplicated.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
  - Your operating system and version
  - Ideally a form of the repo, and the branch of your test example
- Alternatively, [`reprexpy`](https://github.com/crew102/reprexpy) can output a minimally reproducible example
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Start a discussion using GitHub's [discussions](https://github.com/canimus/cuallee/discussions)
Open or join a discussion on the future or state of `cuallee`
If you want to propose a new feature, this is the right place to do it! Just start a discussion, and
let us know why you think this feature would be a good addition to `cuallee` (by possibly including some usage examples).
